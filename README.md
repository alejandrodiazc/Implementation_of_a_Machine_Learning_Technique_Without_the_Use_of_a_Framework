The following repository aims to demonstrate the implementation of a machine learning classification technique (in this case, Logistic Regression), without the use if a framework or library of functions.

In order to do so, I had to implement some Python3 code, where I wrote a series of functions that implement the mathematical methods behind the Logistic Regression. Then, for trying out the result, I used the Iris daset with a few modifications, to verify if the algorithm worked properly.
